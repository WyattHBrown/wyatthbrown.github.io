        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I work as an A/V Engineer in Theatre Production. I have been programming for 8 years, I specialize in Python and JS. I own a Theatre Production Company known as ComedyBox Canada, and I own a separate tech company known as VestBot. I like to try a bit of everything, but I mainly like to do stuff in the digital technology field. I always like to customize something to my liking, whether it be a workspace, to an entire Operating System, if I can customize it, I will.</p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a High School Nerd. I always have had a passion with technology since I was young. Ever since I got my hands on my first computer I have always tried to make something out of it. I have been taking apart and repairing technology since elementary. I still strive to have the same interest in hands on learning when it comes to technology. In my downtime, I can either be found designing, whether it be Web design or art in general, or working on improving my technical experience. I even got my own Server that I host myself, just to try some new things out, and as a general cloud storage device.</p>
<p>I am currently one of the Developer Beta testers for iOS, MacOS, iPadOS and WatchOS</p>
<p>My portfolio has a lot of sides to it. Whether it be theatre production to linux d evelopment, it is quite broad. I always try to take a lead in what I do. I love my job and everything it can be. I always see opportunity and how it can be handled. I started my own company at the start of the pandemic and I have been growing it ever since. Taking opportunity during my downtime to educate myself with new and interesting things.</p>
<p>I have made quite a few things involving my technical experience, whether it be a handheld desktop computer, or a little news feed for your desk, I have always wanted to make things, and instead of just going out and buying it, I think it is a bit more interesting to make it myself.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Currently I am working with local groups and non-profit organizations in the Theatre Production field, which is why I decided to start my own company for theatre production. I also am working with my high school to further educate myself with A/V engineering. I often work with Russell's Association of the Performing Arts for the light's and sound, and love doing it every time. I am often the one helping out for school plays or dances with light and sound, or even school events as the Camera Operator. I have even had the chance to go to other schools when they need someone to help out with light and sound for school plays. Which is how I got into Specialist High Skills Major's. Oh, and I am Red Cross Certified for First Aid!</p>

<p>I am majoring in Computer Science, but started off programming as an interest. I started off just making little things, but then got into the linux field and really took it from there. Having used linux for 6 years, I have expanded my horizons dramatically and hope to continue doing so for the future. I started doing Engineering as a side product of my interest in programming, and have dramatically increased my interest for the digital and physical technology industry.</p>

<p>Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in the computer repair industry. My father, who had been working in the IT field well beyond my existence, Had taught me most of the ins and outs of computer repair, and every time I went to visit his work, I would always pick up on what he was doing. Which is why, at a young age, I had started doing computer repair in my elementary school. when I had started getting older, I would often be called down to different classes to help fix a technical issue that they might have. Which carried off into my High School education. Where even then, I would be called out of class to help fix a technical issue that someone is having, whether it be a student or a teacher.</p>
